## Overview

This report analyzes weight trends and litter box usage patterns for each of my four cats. The data was collected from a CSV exported from a [Litter-Robot 4](https://www.litter-robot.com/) automatic litter box between November 5th and December 2nd, 2024.

### Methodology and Data Cleaning

The following considerations should be noted:

* **Scale Precision:** The precision and consistency of the Litter-Robot's scale is unknown. However, I did not observe any glaringly inaccurate readings collected under normal circumstances.
* **Cat Identification:**  Recordings are attributed to specific cats based on weight ranges, assuming each cat maintains a distinct weight profile. Gilbert and Frankie are the closest to overlapping in ranges, but this did not appear to happen. Unfortunately, cat identification information is not exported in the CSV so must be calculated again during the data cleaning.
* **Outlier Removal:**  Extreme weight outliers, due to erroneously recorded events such as litter refilling and maintenance, have been removed from the dataset.
* **Data Consolidation:** Consecutive weight recordings within 15-minute intervals have been averaged to reduce noise and simplify analysis.
* **Relative Scale:** From my [research](https://www.bayshorelovespets.com/How-Often-Should-a-Healthy-Cat-Use-Its-Litter-Box--1-13319.html), a healthy cat typically uses the litter box 3-5 times per day which translates to around 21-35 times per week. However, I am a code monkey, not a veterinarian, so this assumption may not be accurate.
* **Limited Scope:** The Litter-Robot only stores data for the previous 30 days, so the trends shown may not be indicative of larger patterns.

### Cat Profiles

All of my cats share these characteristics:

* **Indoor:** They live exclusively indoors.
* **Diet:** Their diet consists primarily of wet food (Friskies 5.5 oz cans), typically consuming 4-6 cans per day, supplemented with dry treats (Temptations, Friskies).
* **Sterilization:** All cats are spayed or neutered.
* **Birthdate:** With the exception of Gilbert, all birthdates are approximate, based on the best guess of the intial veterinarian who treated the cat after adoption.

```{r, echo = FALSE, cat-profiles}

# Prepare table with basic information
cat_profiles <- data.frame(
  Cat = c("Gilbert", "Speck", "Catness", "Frankie"),
  Birthdate = c("2013-07-27", "2017-04-15", "2020-07-15", "2021-11-15"),
  Sex = c("Male", "Female", "Male", "Male"),
  "Health_Issues" = c("Hyperthyroid, tooth decay, vomiting (chronic)", "tooth decay, diarrhea (chronic)", "None", "None")
)

# Convert birthdate to date
cat_profiles$Birthdate <- ymd(cat_profiles$Birthdate)

# Calculate age

```{python, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE, python-data-cleaning}

# make sure to activate the virtual environment before running
# source .venv/bin/activate

from cleaner import CatDataCleaner

cleaner = CatDataCleaner()

```

```{r, echo = FALSE, data-prep}

### Prep the data for R ###

# Load data after initial cleaning in Python.
cat_data <- read.csv("cat_weights.csv")

# Convert timestamp to datetime
cat_data$Timestamp <- ymd_hms(cat_data$Timestamp)

# Set date range
# TODO: confirm if end_date values after 00:00 are getting cut off
start_date <- ymd("2024-11-05")
end_date <- ymd("2024-12-02")
num_weeks <- as.numeric(difftime(end_date, start_date, units = "weeks"))

# Add weekly data
cat_data$Week <- floor(as.numeric(difftime(cat_data$Timestamp, start_date, units = "days")) / 7) + 1
cat_data$Weekday <- wday(cat_data$Timestamp)

# Summary stats for each cat
cat_summary <- cat_data %>%
  group_by(Cat) %>%
  summarize(
    Min_Weight = min(Weight),
    Max_Weight = max(Weight),
    Avg_Weight = round(mean(Weight), 1),
    Median_Weight = median(Weight),
    SD_Weight = round(sd(Weight), 2),
    Total_Visits = n(),
    Weekly_Visits = round(Total_Visits / num_weeks, 1)
  )

# Generate new df with weekly data that is easier to graph
weekly_stats <- cat_data %>%
  filter(Timestamp >= start_date, Timestamp <= end_date) %>%
  group_by(Cat, Week) %>%
  summarize(
    Avg_Weekly_Weight = round(mean(Weight), 1),
    Total_Weekly_Visits = n(),
    Mean_Daily_Visits = round(Total_Weekly_Visits / 7, 1),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# Get cat names
cat_list <- unique(weekly_stats$Cat)

```

## Summary Statistics

Key statistics for each cat's weight and litter box usage are summarized in the following table and plots.

```{r, echo = FALSE, summary-table}

# Basic stats
kable(cat_summary, caption = "Summary Statistics per Cat")

```

<br>

```{r, echo = FALSE, line-plot}

# Line plot with facet wrap
ggplot(cat_data, aes(x = Timestamp, y = Weight, color = Cat)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "loess", span = 0.3, formula = 'y ~ x') +
  labs(title = "Weight Over Time for Each Cat", x = "Timestamp", y = "Weight") +
  facet_wrap(~Cat, scales = "free_y") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

```{r, echo = FALSE, density-plot}

# Density plot with facet wrap
ggplot(cat_data, aes(x = Weight, fill = Cat)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Cat Weights", x = "Weight", y = "Density") +
  facet_wrap(~ Cat, ncol = 2, scales = "free_y") +
  theme_bw()

```

#### Observations

* **Gilbert**: The heaviest cat, averaging 12.5 lbs, Gilbert (aka Biralo) maintains a consistent weight (SD = 0.15 lbs). He is also the most frequent litter box user, averaging 30.9 visits per week. Although this usage is on the higher end of a healthy range, his consistent weight suggests that the Methimazole dosage (3.75 mg) is effective.

* **Speck**: Weighing significantly less, averaging 8.2 lbs (SD = 0.17 lbs), Speck (aka Nunu) uses the litter box almost as frequently as Gilbert (29.8 visits/week). Although she exhibits consistent weight, this relatively high usage might warrant further observation.

* **Catness**:  At an average of 10.1 lbs (SD = 0.17 lbs), Catness exhibits consistent weight and moderate litter box usage (21.5 visits/week). Although his usage is within the healthy range, it is on the extreme lower end and might warrant further observation.

* **Frankie**: The second heaviest cat (11.6 lbs average, SD = 0.14 lbs) shows the lowest litter box usage (12.4 visits/week). While his consistent weight is a positive sign, the significantly low usage is concerning and warrants further investigation.

## Comparative Weekly Trends

The following plots visualize weekly changes in weight and litter box usage for each cat comparatively.

```{r, echo = FALSE, comparative-weekly-weight-plot}

# Plot average weekly weight
ggplot(weekly_stats, aes(x = Week, y = Avg_Weekly_Weight, color = Cat)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Average Weekly Weight", x = "Week", y = "Weight (lbs)")

```

```{r, echo = FALSE, comparative-usage-plot}

# Plot weekly litter box usage
ggplot(weekly_stats, aes(x = Week, y = Mean_Daily_Visits, color = Cat)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mean Daily Litter Box Usage per Week", x = "Week", y = "Visits")

```

## Weight Statistics

The following plots provide a more detailed look into weight trends for each individual cat. The standard error of the regression line is shaded in gray, representing a 95% confidence interval.

```{r, echo = FALSE, individual-weight-plots}

# Run a for loop to get plots for all the cats
for (cat_name in unique(cat_data$Cat)) {
  cat_subset <- cat_data %>% filter(Cat == cat_name)

  # Set regression line color based on cat name
  line_color <- if (cat_name == "Gilbert") {
    "blue"
  } else if (cat_name == "Speck") {
    "purple"
  } else if (cat_name == "Catness") {
    "red"
  } else if (cat_name == "Frankie") {
    "green"  
  } else {
    "black"
  }

  plot <- ggplot(cat_subset, aes(x = Timestamp, y = Weight)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, se = TRUE, color = line_color, show.legend = FALSE) +
    labs(title = paste("Weight Trend for", cat_name), x = "Date", y = "Weight (lbs)") +
    theme_bw()

  print(plot)
